    "Embedded feature selection methods integrate the feature selection process within the model training process itself, making it efficient and often highly effective. Here are some common techniques used in embedded feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regularization Methods\n",
    "Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. It can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. While it doesn't perform feature selection, it helps in managing multicollinearity and improving model stability.\n",

    "Elastic Net: Combines L1 and L2 regularization techniques. It performs variable selection and regularization simultaneously, particularly useful when there are multiple correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decision Trees and Ensembles\n",
    "Decision Trees: Naturally perform feature selection by splitting nodes based on feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests: Use an ensemble of decision trees and measure feature importance based on the average impurity decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs): Build an ensemble of trees where each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. Feature importance is determined similarly to random forests.\n",
    "\n",

    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): SVMs can use RFE to recursively remove the least important features and re-fit the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the Filter method for feature selection is efficient and simple, it does have its drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ignores Feature Interactions: The Filter method evaluates each feature individually based on statistical criteria, which means it doesn't consider how features might interact with each other. As a result, important combinations of features might be overlooked.\n",

    "* Model Independence: Since it works independently of the machine learning model, the selected features might not be the best fit for the specific algorithm being used. This can lead to suboptimal model performance.\n",

    "* Threshold Selection: Determining the right threshold for feature selection can be challenging. If the threshold is too high, relevant features might be excluded; if it's too low, irrelevant features might be included.\n",

    "* Exploratory Data Analysis: During exploratory data analysis, you might use the Filter method to gain insights into the relationship between individual features and the target variable without committing to a specific learning algorithm or complex model training.\n",
